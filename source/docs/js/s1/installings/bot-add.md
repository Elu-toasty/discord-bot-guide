## Getting the auth

Inviting your Discord bot to your server is really easy. For this step we will need to go to the auth section of the developer page.

**Click OAUTH2**

There are a lot of options on this screen. In the scopes you want to select `bot` and `applications.commands`. The bot scope tells discord that your application URL is for your bot authentication. While applications.commands is simplly how you can use [slash commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands) in the future.

When these new options are selected you will see the bot permissions dropdown. Select what your bot will need to function. If your unsure its best to go with Administrator. This will give your bot all permissions in any server.

## URl

Next we will copy and paste the bot URL into a new tab, and here we can invite the bot to our server. If everything goes well you should see this.
