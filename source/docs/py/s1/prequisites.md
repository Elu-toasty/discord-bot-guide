## Getting Started

This tutorial will start off with the basics of the [Python Discord API](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) wrapper. Building a solid foundation on the basics of PDA will allow us to build more complex projects as the tutorial progresses.

In this tutorial, we will be using the [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), created by Microsoft _(community edition will suffice)_.

:::caution
