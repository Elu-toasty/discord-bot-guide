## Prior knowledge

Before you start this tutorial, I strongly recommend learning some basic Python. Unless you have a basic understanding of Python syntax, this tutorial might not be of great use to you as lots of things may not make sense.

Some things that you need to understand are

- Data types (Strings, integers, floats)
- Collection types (Lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Type conversion
- Variables
- Built-in functions and functions
- Classes

I understand that you may want a discord bot to be your first project, but try experimenting with basic python first.
I recommend starting off with the [Python Documentation](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html)

## A place to edit code

Of course, you need a place to actually write the code! Some free choices include

- [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

I'm sure there are separate documents for each of those programs, so learn how to set those up, and come back once you're done.
