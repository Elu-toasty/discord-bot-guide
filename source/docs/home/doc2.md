**_Hey there! Want to contribute to the documentation?_**

That's great, the project is in [alpha](/blog/2021/03/04/Alpha) also we are always looking to add to contributors.

### Things to know before continuing

**One:** You must have a [Discord](https://discord.com/) account and a [Github](https://github.com/) account to join the team. These are both applications we will be using daily.

**Two:** You must have some knowledge of programming in a Discord supported language - `javascript, python, java, etc`. We are looking for people who are capable of teaching others how to learn, this means you must have a strong understanding of the content before hand.

_We are willing to accept programmers who dont know Discord API as long as they have the proper skills to learn._

**Three:** You must be 13+ or older to apply.

**_Why?_** There must be a limitation on maturity for our developer team. Furthermore Discord people of age 12 or younger to use the platform either.
