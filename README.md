# _Branch in development_

## Why was this created?

Thanks for checking out our GitHub page! The Discord Bot Guide was originally created by [ThatGuyJamal](https://github.com/ThatGuyJamal). He is a fellow software engineer and Highschool student. 

> I have always loved using Discord for many years now. Discord bots were never something I thought about building myself until a friend asked me about them. Soon I began to research them and build them myself. While I'm no prophetical in Full-Stack development, I decided to get a few people together and create this website. My goal is to improve all of our development skills by building real-world documentation that people can use. Teaching others is always fun when you enjoy it. *ThatGuyJamal#2695 - 2021*

### Getting Started

The best way to enjoy our documentation is on the [official website](https://github.com/DeepWebDevelopers/discord-bot-guide). If you wish to, you can view any source code from the website. We don't guarantee with will be 100% readable. 



### Want to support us?

You can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/NbqBQbaejS) for the lasted information about the docs and support on it.

### How to contribute?

We are always looking for **free** help. If you wish to contribute to the documentation you can clone our Github repo and make your changes. There are a lot of branches but only clone the alpha branch as it has the most up-to-date code. 

After editing the code you can make a pull request with your changes and they will be reviewed. If everything is good your changes will be pulled into the main branch.
